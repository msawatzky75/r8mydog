		<h1>About r8mydog</h1>
		<p>I, <a href="/profiles?u=spiffpitt"><strong>Matthew Paul Sawatzky</strong></a> am currently working on devolping r8mydog as a Content Managment System website. r8mydog is a hot dog rating site where users post photos with titles and captions for others to rate.</p>
		<p>I credit the idea to my friend <a href="/profiles?u=pxlnght"><strong>Brian</strong></a> who prompted a site to rate hot dogs when I had asked. </p>
		<p>While I am still devolping the website, i am still open to ideas feel free to let me know at <a href="mailto:reluctantbee@gmail.com">reluctantbee@gmail.com</a>.</p>
